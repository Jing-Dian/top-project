        <p>If you like spinach and Mexican food, you'll love these easy chicken enchiladas made with ricotta cheese and spinach.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 large cooked chicken breast halves, diced</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach - thawed, drained, and squeezed dry</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
            <li>5 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 (10 ounce) cans enchilada sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat on medium-high. Saute onion and garlic for 3 minutes, or until onion is tender-crisp. Stir in broth and rosemary; bring to a boil. Stir in artichoke hearts and spinach; reduce heat, cover and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/4 of the artichoke mixture in the bottom of the prepared baking dish; top with 3 cooked noodles. Sprinkle 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese over noodles. Repeat layers 2 more times, ending with artichoke mixture and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle crumbled feta on top.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture bubbles, about 4 minutes. Pour in milk, stirring briskly to avoid lumps. Continue to stir until sauce thickens and bubbles again, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano and provolone until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce over pasta-vegetable mixture and stir to combine. Taste and adjust seasonings. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Toss remaining 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano with bread crumbs in a small bowl and sprinkle over casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
